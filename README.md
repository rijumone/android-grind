# android-grind

Project to grind your way to faboulous riches. On Android games and such.

##### Common steps for all games/apps (device)
- Install the game/app on your device
- Connect to your device over adb (wirelessly works a bit slow in my experience since screenshots will be transferred)

##### Common steps for all games/apps (machine)
- Create a virtualenv
- Install the dependencies outlined in `requirements.txt`
- `mkdir tmp`

##### Need For Speed - No Limits
- Launch the game on your device
